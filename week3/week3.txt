1. run docker-compose file:
    docker-compose up -d

2. install csv file into dataops folder which is mounted to the folder with the same name inside container:
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erkansirin78/datasets/master/Wine.csv

3. create '/user/root/hdfs_odev' directory in hdfs:
    hdfs dfs -mkdir /user
    hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/root
    hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/root/hdfs_odev

4. put the installed csv file in hdfs directory which was created in the previous step:
    hdfs dfs -put Wine.csv /user/root/hdfs_odev

5. view first few rows of csv:
    hdfs dfs -head /user/root/hdfs_odev/Wine.csv

6. create a new '/user/root/hdfs_odev' directory in hdfs:
    hdfs dfs -mkdir /tmp
    hdfs dfs -mkdir /tmp/hdfs_odev

7. copy the file in the previous directory to the new directory '/tmp/hdfs_odev':
    hdfs dfs -cp /user/root/hdfs_odev/Wine.csv /tmp/hdfs_odev

8. list the files in the directory:
    hdfs dfs -ls /tmp/hdfs_odev
    hdfs dfs -ls hdfs://cluster-master:9000/tmp/hdfs_odev

9. delete the copied file from the directory '/tmp/hdfs_odev' with skipping the trash:
    hdfs dfs -rm -r -skipTrash hdfs://cluster-master:9000/tmp/hdfs_odev
